# React_Questions
Q.1 
Ans.
Q.2 what is the current version of React (v18.0);
Ans.  Our latest major version includes out-of-the-box improvements like automatic batching, new APIs like startTransition, and streaming server-side .
Q.3 What are the advantages of using React?
Ans. Increases the application's performance with Virtual DOM
      - code easy to read and write
      - it renders both on client and server side (SSR).
      - Easy to integrate with frameworks (Angular, Backbone)
      -It is declarative,Write once, and learn anywhere,Fast, efficient, and easy to learn.
Q.4  What are the major features of React?
Ans.- It uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
    - Supports server-side rendering
    - Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding
    - Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.
    -Virtual DOM,One-way data binding,Performance,Components,Simplicity.
Q.5  What are the limitations of React? 
Ans. - Lack of Proper Documentation
    - Development Speed
    - JSX - JSX may be difficult for some devlopers to understand 
    - Problems With SEO
Q.6  Why we use react?
Ans. React can be used to build web, mobile, and desktop applications, making it a versatile framework for cross-platform development.
Q.7  Why is react fast?
Ans.React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster. Virtual DOM compares the components' previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were changed, instead of updating all of the components again, as conventional web applications do.
Q.8 . what is a single page application?
Ans. A single page application is a website or web application that dynamically rewrites a current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.
Q.9  React, is it framework or library?
Ans. React is merely a library that deals with views.
Q.10 Why we use redux? 
Ans.  Simply put, Redux is used to maintain and update data across your applications for multiple components to share, all while remaining independent of the components.
Q.11  What are diff key things of redux?
Ans.There are three core components in Redux â€” actions, store, and reducers.
Q.12 Why react is diff then other framework?
Ans. Compared to other frontend frameworks, the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure. This flexibility, in turn, saves a huge amount of time and cost to businesses,Because of its component-based approach and virtual DOM, React is a lot faster than other frameworks.
Q.13  React, how different from plain js
Ans.  React has a steeper learning curve than vanilla javascript as it embraces component-based architecture and JSX syntax. Furthermore, React documentation and community support make it easier to learn and build complex applications once the basics are grasped.
Q.14  Why we use js?
Ans. JavaScript (JS) is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web pages interactive. It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.
Q.15 What is JSX?
Ans. JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
Q.16  what is JSX in reactjs?
Ans.  JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
Q.17  Why we use jsx?  
Ans. JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements. You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.
Q.18  Can I write if else condition in JSX?
Ans. if-else statements don't work inside JSX. This is because JSX is just syntactic sugar for function calls and object construction.
Q.19 . What is JSX and What is the relation of JSX with React.createElement ?
Ans.JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.
Q.20  does the web browser understand JSX directly ?  
 Ans. No,Browsers can't read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand them.
Q.21 Can web browsers read JSX directly?
No,Browsers can't read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand them.
Q.22  What is Babel?
Ans.  Babel is transpiler[to translate the code] which convert the latest version of JavaScript code into the one that the browser understands.
Q.23 How do you create elements in React without JSX?
Ans. Yes, it is possible to use React without JSX,. So, anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript.
Q.24 why do we use className instead of class keyword as an Attribute in jsx?
Ans.  The only reason behind the fact that it uses className over class is that the class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript and since we use JSX in React which itself is the extension of JavaScript, so we have to use className instead of class attribute.
the class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript and since we use JSX in React which itself is the extension of JavaScript
Q.25  DOM?
Ans.  Document Object Model 
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document.
Q.26 what is virtualDOM? explain the same
Ans  React uses Virtual DOM which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
    - It is exactly the same as DOM, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document.
    - Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen
    - In virtual DOM, it first create the tree of components, and when we do changes in any component only that component is re-rendered.
Q.27  How Virtual DOM works?
Ans. In virtual DOM, it first create the tree of components, and when we do changes in any component only that component is re-rendered.
Q.28  Why react maintains virtual dom.
Ans React uses the virtual DOM as a strategy to compute minimal DOM operations when re-rendering the UI, React uses Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
Q.29  Describe about Virtual Dom and real DOM?
